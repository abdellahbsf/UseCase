# Binary Instrumenter for Collecting Application Data

The binary instrumenter, represented by the `minerva-agent-1.0.jar`, is a Java-based agent designed to instrument the byte code of Java monolithic applications. This instrumentation enables the collection of runtime traces when these applications run.

## Prerequisites

- Your application must be installed and running on a server or Liberty.
- The static analysis step should have been executed beforehand.

## Procedure

1. Verify that you have a directory containing three JSON files generated by the static analysis.

2. Configure the application server by adding the following argument to its Java virtual machine (JVM):

   ```bash
   -javaagent:./instrumenter/minerva-agent-1.0.jar=<agent-config-path>

- <agent-config-path> is the fully qualified path of the directory containing the three JSON files created by the code analyzer.
  
### Note:

- If your application is installed and running on WebSphere Application Server, use the administrative console to specify the JVM argument.
- If your application is on Liberty, create or update a jvm.options file to specify the JVM argument.

Start the application server and your application with the -javaagent JVM argument enabled.

# Recording Business Use Cases Interactively

When both the use case recorder and the application server are running on the same machine, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
javac usecase_w.java
java usecase_w

#
This will open a terminal on your machine, enabling you to start recording use cases. Once you finish recording, a message will appear, indicating the successful execution of the command. As a result, a JSON file will be added to your directory.
