# Binary Instrumenter for Collecting Application Data

The binary instrumenter, represented by the `minerva-agent-1.0.jar`, is a Java-based agent designed to instrument the byte code of Java monolithic applications. This instrumentation enables the collection of runtime traces when these applications run.

## Prerequisites

- Your application must be installed and running on a server or Liberty.
- The static analysis step should have been executed beforehand.

## Procedure

1. Verify that you have a directory containing three JSON files generated by the static analysis.

2. Configure the application server by adding the following argument to its Java virtual machine (JVM):

   ```bash
   -javaagent:<agent-install-path>/minerva-agent-1.0.jar=<agent-config-path>
